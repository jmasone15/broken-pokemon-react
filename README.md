# Help My Project Won't Work!!!
## User Story
- I am a new developer trying to add some great new projects to my portfolio. But after watching a YouTube tutorial on this Pokemon app, I am stuck and can't figure out where I went wrong. I need to be able to have a working app so that I can add it to my portfolio.

## Definition of Done
The application is currently experiencing five issues.
 - Why is my app routing to the 404 page instead of the home page?
 - When I click the random button nothing happens?
 - When I click the random button it works, but it just loads forever?
 - Why are all of the names of Pokemon messed up?
 - When I click an evolution pokemon, it loads forever?

 ## Bonus
 - Are there any optimizations you can do to the API calls?
